# Unlearn

Redefining the biochemical learning experience. . .

## Un. . . What?
Unlearn is a web app created to serve as a coaching and practice platform to biochemist students in their second year of study, sytruggling to understand or remember cumbersome biochemistry concepts/information. 

It features discussions and tips section for coaching and a quiz section for practice. It integrates a user-centered approach geared towards optimizing comprehension and exam preparedness amongst students with as little time and effort as possible.

## Why Do I Need this "Unlearn"?
Well. . . firstly if you are not a student of biochemistry nor interested in learning/mastering some basic/intermediate [biochemical cocepts](), contained in the web app, then  this application is not for you. Alternatively, if you find yourself having to understand, memorize or master biochemical cocepts especially for an upcoming exam/test, then this app was made with you in mind!

## Okay. . . How Do I Get Started?
